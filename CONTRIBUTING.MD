2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/lightweight-spring-actuator-monitor.git
   cd lightweight-spring-actuator-monitor
   ```

3. **Open** the HTML file in your browser for testing
4. **Test** with a running Spring Boot application with Actuator enabled

### 🧪 Testing Your Changes
- Test with different Spring Boot versions (2.x, 3.x)
- Verify compatibility with major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Test responsive design on mobile devices
- Check console for JavaScript errors

## 📝 Commit Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification with additional issue referencing:

### Branch Naming Convention
```
<type>/<issue-number>_<description>
```

Examples:
- `feat/42_dark_mode`
- `fix/7_memory_leak`
- `docs/13_readme_update`

### Commit Message Format
```
[<reference>] <type>: <description>

[optional body]
```

#### Issue References
- For work in progress:
  ```
  [refs #42] feat: implement dark mode
  [refs #42] feat: add initial theme support - still working on color scheme
  ```

- For completing work:
  ```
  [fixes #7] fix: resolve memory calculation
  [closes #13] docs: update browser support
  [resolves #15] feat: add CPU chart
  ```

### Types
- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code formatting (no functional changes)
- **refactor**: Code restructuring (no functional changes)
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks

### Commit Best Practices
1. Keep commits atomic and focused
2. Write clear and descriptive messages
3. Reference issues appropriately
4. Squash commits before merging:
   ```bash
   # If you have multiple commits in your feature branch
   git checkout your-feature-branch
   git rebase -i main
   # Mark commits as 'squash' except the first one
   # Update the commit message to be comprehensive
   git push --force-with-lease
   ```

### Examples
```bash
[refs #15] feat: add CPU usage trending chart

Implements a mini chart showing CPU usage over the last 10 data points
to help identify usage patterns and spikes.

[fixes #15] feat: complete CPU monitoring implementation

The timer wasn't being properly cleared when switching tabs,
causing multiple timers to run simultaneously.

[refs #18] docs: update README with browser compatibility info

Adds section explaining which browsers are supported and
known limitations with older versions.
```

### Issue Reference Keywords
