# üöÄ Lightweight Spring Actuator Monitor

A zero-setup HTML dashboard for monitoring Spring Boot Actuator metrics in real-time. 
Download, open in your browser, and start monitoring immediately.

This standalone dashboard transforms raw Actuator endpoints into an intuitive interface with live metrics, progress bars, 
and detailed explanations of what each metric means and when to take action. 
Perfect for development, debugging, and learning about JVM performance without the complexity of enterprise monitoring stacks.

## üéØ Why This Project Exists

This dashboard was created to fill a specific need for a monitoring solution that balances simplicity with detailed insight. 
While many tools exist, they often fall short in one of these key areas:

**Simplicity and Zero-Friction Deployment**: Unlike enterprise monitoring stacks (Spring Boot Admin, Prometheus, Grafana, ELK), 
there's no infrastructure to set up, no configuration files to maintain, and no learning curve. 
It's a single HTML file that works anywhere‚Äîfrom local development to quick production troubleshooting.

**Transparency and Trust**: As a lightweight, open-source solution with readable code, developers can understand exactly 
how it works, customize it for their needs, and contribute improvements. No black boxes, no vendor lock-in, no hidden costs.

**Educational Value with Actionable Insights**: While tools like Spring Boot Admin show you the metrics, this dashboard 
explains what they mean, when to be concerned, and how to optimize. Each metric comes with context, thresholds, 
and practical JVM tuning advice‚Äîturning monitoring into a learning experience.

Whether you're debugging memory issues during development, demonstrating JVM behavior in a workshop, or need quick insights 
without spinning up a full monitoring stack, this tool bridges the gap between "too simple" and "too complex."

Perfect for developers who value pragmatic solutions over enterprise complexity.

## üìä Supported Metrics

- **Memory**: Heap Used/Max, Non-Heap Usage
- **Performance**: CPU Usage, Live Threads
- **Garbage Collection**: Memory Allocated
- **Progress bars** showing memory utilization

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Download** the HTML file from this repository
2. **Open** it in any modern web browser
3. **Configure** your Spring Boot application URL (default: http://localhost:8080)
4. **Click Connect** and start monitoring!

### Prerequisites

Your Spring Boot application needs to have Actuator enabled:

1. Add the Actuator dependency to your `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

2. Basic configuration in your `application.yml` or `application.properties`:

```yaml
server:
  port: 8080  # Verify this matches the URL in the dashboard

management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: health,metrics
  endpoint:
    health:
      show-details: always
```

3. **Optional: CORS Configuration**

If you encounter access errors when trying to connect to your Spring Boot application from the dashboard, you'll need to enable CORS. Add this to your configuration:

```yaml
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      cors:
        allowed-origins: "*"        # For development only
        allowed-methods: GET,POST
        allowed-headers: "*"
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: For production environments, replace "*" with specific allowed origins for better security.

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Development** monitoring during local testing
- **Quick debugging** of memory issues
- **Learning** about JVM metrics and their meanings
- **Lightweight alternative** to heavy monitoring solutions
- **Demo purposes** for Spring Boot applications

## üì± Screenshots

*Coming soon - add screenshots of the dashboard here*

## üîß Configuration

The dashboard automatically detects and displays:
- JVM Memory metrics (heap/non-heap)
- System CPU usage
- Thread information
- Garbage Collection statistics

Simply change the "Actuator URL" field to point to your Spring Boot application.
