## üìù Versioning and Commit Standards

### Branch Naming Convention
```
<type>/<issue-number>_<description>
```

Example:
- `feat/42_dark_mode`
- `fix/7_memory_leak`
- `docs/13_readme_update`

Note: Always use underscore (_) to separate words in branch names for better readability.

### Commit Message Format
```
[<reference>] <type>: <description>
```

#### Issue References:
- Work in progress: `[refs #7]`
- Completing work: 
  - `[fixes #7]`
  - `[closes #7]`
  - `[resolves #7]`

#### Types:
- `feat` - New features
- `fix` - Bug fixes
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `style` - Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
