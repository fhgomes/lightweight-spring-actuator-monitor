# Development Guidelines

## üìù Versioning and Commit Standards

### Semantic Versioning
We follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/):

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

Example: 1.1.0
```

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backwards-compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backwards-compatible)

Version numbers should never contain leading zeros.

### Version Bumping Guidelines
- Breaking changes -> MAJOR bump (e.g., 1.1.0 -> 2.0.0)
- New features -> MINOR bump (e.g., 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
- Bug fixes -> PATCH bump (e.g., 1.1.0 -> 1.1.1)

### Branch Naming Convention
```
<type>/<issue-number>_<description>
```

Example:
- `feat/42_dark_mode`
- `fix/7_memory_leak`
- `docs/13_readme_update`

Note: Always use underscore (_) to separate words in branch names for better readability.

### Commit Message Format
```
[<reference>] <type>: <description>
```

#### Issue References:
- Work in progress: `[refs #7]`
- Completing work: 
  - `[fixes #7]`
  - `[closes #7]`
  - `[resolves #7]`

#### Types:
- `feat` - New features
- `fix` - Bug fixes
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `style` - Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor` - Code restructuring
- `test` - Adding/updating tests
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks

#### Examples:
```
[refs #42] feat: add dark mode support
[fixes #7] fix: correct memory calculation
[closes #13] docs: update installation guide
[refs #15] style: format code according to guidelines
```

### GitHub Integration and Issue Closing

#### Automatic Issue Closing
GitHub automatically closes issues when specific keywords are used in commit messages pushed to the default branch (`main` or `master`).

**‚úÖ Correct Keywords for Auto-Closing:**
- `[fixes #7]` - Closes issue #7
- `[closes #7]` - Closes issue #7  
- `[resolves #7]` - Closes issue #7

**‚ùå Common Mistakes (Won't Close Issues):**
- `[refs #7]` - Only references, doesn't close
- `[fix #7]` - Missing 's' at the end
- `[close #7]` - Missing 's' at the end
- `[resolved #7]` - Wrong tense
- `fixes #7` - Missing brackets (project format requirement)
- `[fixes#7]` - Missing space after keyword

#### Closing Multiple Issues

**‚ùå Incorrect Format (Won't Work):**
```
[closes #8 #9 #11] feat: add memory monitoring
```

**‚úÖ Correct Formats:**

**Option 1: Multiple bracket references**
```
[closes #8] [closes #9] [closes #11] feat: add memory monitoring
```

**Option 2: Main issue in brackets, others in body (Recommended)**
```
[closes #8] feat: add real-time memory monitoring

Closes #9
Closes #11

- Replace static memory values with live data
- Add trending indicators and historical tracking
- Implement progress bars and usage visualization
```

**Option 3: Mixed keywords in body**
```
[closes #8] feat: add real-time memory monitoring

Fixes #9
Resolves #11
```

#### Integration Requirements

For automatic issue closing to work:

1. **Default Branch**: Commit must be pushed to repository's default branch
2. **Repository Access**: Must have write access to the repository
3. **Issue Existence**: Referenced issues must exist in the same repository
4. **Exact Format**: Follow the project's bracket format exactly: `[keyword #number]`

#### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Problem**: "My commit message didn't close the GitHub issue"

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Used correct closing keyword (`fixes`, `closes`, `resolves`)
- [ ] Issue number exists in the same repository
- [ ] Commit was pushed to the default branch (not a feature branch)
- [ ] Used project's bracket format: `[closes #7]`
- [ ] Keyword is lowercase
- [ ] Space exists between keyword and issue number

**Feature Branch Workflow**: 
If working on feature branches, issues close when the branch is merged to `main`, not on individual commits to the feature branch.

#### Advanced Examples

**Complex Feature with Multiple Related Issues:**
```
[closes #42] feat: implement comprehensive memory monitoring dashboard

Closes #43: Add real-time metric updates
Closes #44: Implement trending indicators
Resolves #45: Add educational tooltips and documentation

- Integrates Spring Boot Actuator endpoints for live data
- Adds historical tracking with up/down trend arrows  
- Implements progress bars with color-coded usage indicators
- Includes comprehensive help documentation for memory metrics
- Updates UI responsiveness across all memory visualization sections
```

**Bug Fix with Related Enhancement:**
```
[fixes #28] fix: resolve NaN values in memory calculations

Closes #29: Add graceful degradation for missing metrics

- Implements proper error handling for startup scenarios
- adds loading states when metrics are not yet available
- Includes defensive programming patterns for edge cases
- Updates user feedback during application initialization
```

## üîÑ Version Control Workflow

1. Always branch from `main`
2. Keep branches focused on single issues
3. Reference issues in commits and PRs
4. Use meaningful commit messages
5. Squash commits before merging when appropriate

## üìã Pull Request Guidelines

### PR Creation Process
1. Ensure your branch is up to date with main
2. Follow the PR template structure
3. Use descriptive titles with issue references
4. Include appropriate labels

### Required Content
1. Clear description of changes
2. Screenshots for UI changes
3. List of tested browsers
4. Documentation updates if needed
5. Completion of PR checklist

### PR Checklist
- [ ] Branch follows naming convention
- [ ] Commits are properly formatted with issue references
- [ ] Changes are tested across supported browsers
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] No unnecessary file changes

### Review Process
1. Address reviewer comments promptly
2. Squash commits when requested
3. Keep PR focused and small
4. Update branch when needed
5. Add test cases for bug fixes
