## Purpose

This directory provides structured context for AI code agents (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.) to:
- Understand the project architecture and goals
- Follow consistent coding standards
- Maintain quality and security best practices
- Navigate the multi-repository ecosystem

## Quick Start for AI

When working with this project, consider:

1. **Single File Focus**: The core dashboard is a single HTML file
2. **No Build Process**: Everything runs client-side
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Must work in modern browsers
4. **Security First**: Especially regarding CORS and data handling

## Key Project Goals

1. Zero-setup monitoring solution
2. Educational tool for understanding JVM metrics
3. Development and debugging aid
4. Lightweight alternative to complex monitoring stacks

## AI Contribution Areas

1. Code optimizations
2. Documentation improvements
3. Security enhancements
4. UX/UI suggestions
5. Testing strategies

## Important Considerations

- Keep changes backward compatible
- Maintain the single-file architecture
- Preserve the educational aspect
- Consider security implications
- Keep performance optimal
