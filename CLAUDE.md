# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## AI Guidelines Structure

To unify all AI code agents, we have detailed AI guidelines, instructions, and rules in the `./.ai` folder.

**Start by reading:**
1. `./.ai/README.md` - Project context & overview
2. `./.ai/guidelines.md` - Coding standards, design principles, and best practices
3. `./.ai/*` - Others

## Important Notes

- Never add only in the specific CLAUDE.md file, instead, add in the appropriate `.ai/*.md` file.
- Always keep the `.ai/` documentation up to date with any changes in coding standards or project context/goals.
