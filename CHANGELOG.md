- Default refresh interval updated from 5 to 10 seconds
- Improved countdown reset functionality for manual refreshes and interval changes

### Fixed
- Trending marks now show actual memory differences instead of total current values
- Resolved "cron function" timing conflicts and duplicate interval creation
